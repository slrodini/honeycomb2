# Honeycomb V2

## Unsupported feature

1. It is not possible yet to perform backward evolution with flavor matching (fixed flavor is trivially possible)
2. It is not yet possible to obtain from the Solution struct the discretized values as vectors on the grid for $T, \Delta T, T_F^\pm$. It is only possible to rotate between evolution basis (gluon, singlet, NSi) to physical basis in terms of $\mathfrak{S}^\pm_f, \mathfrak{F}^\pm$ (the latter two for the gluon are the same between evolution and physical)
